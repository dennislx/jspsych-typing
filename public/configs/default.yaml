  <p><strong>What makes some activities more immersive and engaging than others?</strong></p>
  <p>We're interested in why people feel effortlessly engaged in some activities (such as engrossing video games), but struggle to attend to other activities (like tedious chores).</p>
  <p>To help us, you'll complete two different versions of a <strong>typing task</strong>. After each version, you'll report how immersed and engaged you felt.</p>
  <p>When you're ready to learn about the first version of the typing task, continue to the next page.</p>
  </div>

practice_p1: &p1 >
  <div class='instruction'> 
  <p>The first version of the typing task takes place over multiple rounds.</p>
  <p>In each round, you'll type two letters—one after the other—as many times as possible in the allotted time. </p>
  <p>For each correct letter you press in sequence, your score will increase by one.</p>
  <p>For instance, if your task is to type <span id=keystroke>a</span> then <span id=keystroke>b</span>, and you type <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>x</span>, your score will increase by <b>4</b>. However, if you type <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>x</span> your score will increase by <b>1</b>.</p>
  <p>We recommend using your two index fingers to type.</p>

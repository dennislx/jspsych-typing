  <div class='instruction'> 
  <p>In this study, you will be completing a series of typing tasks.</p>
  <p>Specifically, you will be asked to type two letters sequentially as many times as possible in the allotted time. </p>
  <p>During the task, a counter at the center of the screen will increase by one for each correct letter you press in sequence. If you press an incorrect letter, the counter will not increase.</p>
  <p>For instance, if the typing task is to repeatedly type <span id=keystroke>a</span> then <span id=keystroke>b</span> and I type <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>x</span> the counter will display <b>4</b>. If I press <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>x</span> the counter will display <b>1</b>.</p>
  </div>

practice_p2: &p2 >
  <div class='instruction'> 
  <p>First, you will complete some practice typing tasks during the <b>practice</b> phase to get used to the task. During the practice phase, your goal is to type the letters as many times as possible during the allotted time.</p>
  <p>Then, you will complete several typing tasks during the <b>bonus</b> phase. You will have the opportunity to earn additional bonus money based on your performance during the bonus phase. You will learn more about earning bonus money after the practice phase.</p>
  <p>Press the <span class="jspsych-btn">Next ></span> button to start the practice phase. All of the rounds of the practice phase will occur one right after the other, with only a brief break in between to inform you of the letters you will press in the next round.</p>

  <p>In this study, you will be completing a series of typing tasks.</p>
  <p>Specifically, you will be asked to type two letters sequentially as many times as possible in the allotted time. </p>
  <p>During the task, a counter at the center of the screen will increase by one for each correct letter you press in sequence. If you press an incorrect letter, the counter will not increase.</p>
  <p>For instance, if the typing task is to repeatedly type <span id=keystroke>a</span> then <span id=keystroke>b</span> and I type <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>b</span><span id=keystroke>x</span> the counter will display <b>4</b>. If I press <span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>a</span><span id=keystroke>x</span> the counter will display <b>1</b>.</p>
